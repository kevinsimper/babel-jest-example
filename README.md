# babel-jest-example - minimal working example

I was getting errors all the time and all the documentation has been fractured during the latest babel 7 upgrade, which means that nearly every tutorial is broken. I found out this solution with using `"babel-core": "^7.0.0-bridge.0"` and `"regenerator-runtime": "^0.13.1"` to give a working codebases.
